# blueprint-pipeline

Uses luigi! If you're using `uv`, just add `luigi` and `factorio-draftsman` to your environment.

If you're using a virtual environment, make sure it's active and install the requirements:
`pip install luigi factorio-draftsman pydantic==2.10.6`

## Usage
Check the Makefile for example usages. By default it uses `uv` but a simple Python version is also included. (It might not work. Makefiles are weird. You can use the commands though.)
